Implementation of a Jump-Based Endless Runner Game built with the [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) framework


## About The Project

The main objective of this project was to build a platform game. The basics of the game are used from the [Endless Runner game](https://www.emanueleferonato.com/2018/11/13/build-a-html5-endless-runner-with-phaser-in-a-few-lines-of-code-using-arcade-physics-and-featuring-object-pooling/) using Phaser and Javascript among other technologies.

## The game

The character runs endlessly on a platform. In the process of the running, the player jumps on the platform and gains points by colliding against coins also avoiding obstacles which is fire for as long as it can because it is an endless journey. When the game is over , the user can restart the game. 

### How to Play

You can jump on the platform by using the upper arrow keys on your keyboard

### How to play

- Input your name on the first page and click the submit button, There is a menu on the next page which are Play, Options, Credits and Scoreboard. You can disable the sound in the options menu. Click on the play menu to start your game. Use the upper arrow on the keyboard to jump from one platform to another and at the same time collide with the coins and avoid fire. Happy gaming!
