## About

The main objective of this project was to build a platform game. The basics of the game are used from the [https://www.emanueleferonato.com/](https://www.emanueleferonato.com/2018/11/13/build-a-html5-endless-runner-with-phaser-in-a-few-lines-of-code-using-arcade-physics-and-featuring-object-pooling/). But, I had to create the overall design of the game, the different scenes, gameplay and scoring system.

## The game

The character runs endlessly on a platform. In the process of the running, the player jumps and gains points by colliding against coins also avoiding obstacles which is fire for as long as it can because it an endless journey. When the game is over , the user can restart the game. 

### How to play
- The user inputs his/her name in order to access the game scene. The player starts running and the user uses the upper arrow keyboard to jump or double jump in order to get to the next platform while colliding with coins and avoiding fire. Each coin has a point and when the player falls down, there is a game over scene where the user can see his/her scores.
